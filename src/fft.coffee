class Fft
  # Fft computes the the Fast Fourier Transform of data, using the Cooleyâ€“Tukey
  # FFT algorithm. The Cooley-Turkey algorithm requires the fft_data's length
  # to be a power of 2, however this is handled automatically. You do NOT need
  # to pad the data manually.
  #
  # data - An array of data, alternating real and imaginary components. If you
  # only have real data (ie displacement data), you need to add 0's in between
  # your real data points. ie: [1,2,3,4] -> [1,0,2,0,3,0,4,0], or use a
  # preprocessor
  #
  # sample_rate - The rate at which data was sampled. The results given by
  # frequency() will have the same units as the sample rate. IE: Hz.
  #
  # preprocessor (optional) - This function will be called with the incoming
  # data as it's argument. You can use the preprocessor to insert 0's for the
  # imaginary component, convert to a 0 based average, or other signal cleanup.

    @amps = []

  # imaginary components

  # forward or reverse, this is the one you want.
